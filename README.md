Welcome ðŸ‘‹,

I think the greatest gift given to mankind is the ability to create, and I love being able to create. Whether it's a software or hardware project, the `Hello World` moment is my favorite because it means I'm stepping out on a new journey of creativity. I do hope you are enjoying this journey as well. I have a few open source projects available here, and I have some insights and lessons available on my [blog](https://zachcardoza.com). I am always open to provding help to anyone that needs, so feel free to send me an email (my username @ gmail).

Enjoy the journey,
